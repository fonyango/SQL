FIFA ANALYTICS
IN THIS NOTEBOOK, I delve deeper into fifa data to unravel some insights from it. I like football and this is an exciting dataset to explore. Follow through with me to learn and to get to discover the gem in this dataset.

HERE, I am using SQLALchemy in Jupyter notebooks with SQLite to conduct my analysis.

Data Source: This dataset is from https://data.world/raghav333/fifa-players and it contains data of Fifa Players over the years.


**My Approach**: MY APPROACH on this analysis is pretty simple. I have created a database called *fifaDB* with one table, soccer, using *SQLIte studio* and then imported it into this notebook. Secondly, I'm using *sqlite RDBMS* to query the database and perform analysis.

In separate notebooks, I will create some interesting and captivating visualizations using some Python libraries.

SO, lets DIVE IN!

Contents:
- **notebook-01.ipynb** contains preliminary exploration of the data.

In coming notebooks, I will dive deeper into queries the table and getting insights from the data.
